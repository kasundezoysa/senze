Secure Smart Home SENZE Protocool
-------------------------------
This protocol provides, authtication, integrity and non-repudiation
of SENZE.

1. A switch(sw1) and owner (u1) who wants to share the control should first obtain
the pbulic keys.
GET #pubkey @u1 #time t1 ^sw1 Signature
Mysensor server delivers the public key as follows
DATA #pubkey PublicKeyOfu1 #time t2 ^mysensors Signature
(If u1 is not esixts, public key will be not present in the SENZE)

GET #pubkey @sw1 #time t3 ^u1 Signature
Mysensor server delivers the public key as follows
DATA #pubkey PublicKeyOfsw1 #time t4 ^mysensors Signature


2. The switch should share it gpio port (gpio13)
and photo to the owner.  
SHARE #gpio13 #photo #msg #time t5 @u1 ^sw1 Signature
The owner sould reply to it as follows
SHARE #msg OK #time t6 @sw1 ^u1 Signature
(In absense of the above SENZE, sw1 should resend it SHARE SENZE)

3. The recipient should cotrol the switch by sending the following SENZE
PUT #gpio13 ON @sw1 #time t7 ^u1 Signature
The switch should response it as follows. 
DATA #gpio13 ON #time t8  ^sw1 Signature

4 Then recipient get the photo as follows
GET #photo @sw1 #time t9 ^u1 Signatue
DATA #photo XXXX @u1 #time t10 ^sw1 Signature
