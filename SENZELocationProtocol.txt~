Secure Location SENZE Protocool
-------------------------------
This protocol provides, authtication, integrity and non-repudiation
of SENZE. 
In addition to that it provides confidentiality of the data

1. A user who wants to share his location should first obtain
the bulic key of the recipient.
GET #pubkey @u2 #time t1 ^u1 Signature
Mysensor server delivers the public key as follows
DATA #pubkey PublicKeyOfu2 #time t2 ^mysensors Signature
(If u2 is not esixts, public key will be not present in the SENZE)

2. The user should share the location (#lat, #lon sensors)
and the symmetric key k1(Encrypted with the public key of u2)
to the recipient.  
SHARE #lat #lon #key E(k1) #time t3 @u2 ^u1 Signature
Recipient should reply to it as follows
SHARE #msg OK #time t4 @u1 ^u2 Signature
(In absense of the above SENZE, sender should resend it SHARE SENZE)

3. The recipient should request the location by sending the following SENZE
GET #lat #lon @u1 #time t5 ^u2 Signature
The sender should response it as follows. 
Locations are encrtped with key k1.
DATA #lat E(x) #lon E(y) #time t6  ^u1 Signature
(Upon received this data SENZE, recipient should decrypt it
and display it on the map.)

4 (Optional Step)  At any time, 
recipient can request a new security key as follows
GET #key @u1 #time t7 ^u2 Signatue
DATA #key E(k2) @u2 #time t8 ^u1 Signature
