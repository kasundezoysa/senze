Secure Location Sharing SENZE Protocool
---------------------------------------

This protocol provides authtication, integrity,
confidentiality and non-repudiation of SENZE. 

1. A user(u1) who wants to share his location should first obtain
the bulic key of the recipient(u2).
GET #pubkey @u2 #time t1 ^u1 Signature
Mysensor server delivers the public key as follows
DATA #pubkey PublicKeyOfu2 #time t2 ^mysensors Signature
(If u2 is not esixts, public key will not be present in the SENZE)

2.The user should share the location and key sensors
(#lat, #lon and #key) to the recipient.
SHARE #lat #lon #key @u2 #time t3 ^u1 Signature
The recipient should reply to it as follows
SHARE #msg OK @u1 #time t4 ^u2 Signature
(In absense of the above SENZE, 
the user should resend the SHARE SENZE)

*** The user performs the first and secod steps only once
at the time of sharing his location sensor. ***

3.The recipient should request AES security key as follows
GET #key @u1 #time t5 ^u2 Signatue
The user should send the symmetric key(k1) by
encrypting it with the public key of the recipient.
DATA #key E(k1) @u2 #time t6 ^u1 Signature

*** The recipient performs the third step only once
and both parties can keep this AES key ****

4.The recipient should request the location by sending the following SENZE
GET #lat #lon @u1 #time t7 ^u2 Signature
The user should response to it as follows. 
Location values are encrtped by using the AES key(k1).
DATA #lat E(x) #lon E(y) @u2 #time t8 ^u1 Signature
(Upon received this DATA SENZE, recipient should decrypt it
and display it on the map.)
